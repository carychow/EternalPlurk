#EternalPlurk


##Introduction

It is a package of my(Cary Chow's, the author) private SDK for Plurk. It requires PHP 5.2 or higher.

From version 2.0, it supports the Plurk API 2.0. Version 1.X supports the Plurk API 1.0 only, but Plurk API 1.0 is deprecated. It means API 1.0 may not add new features to it.

Also, there are no statements about when will it be unsupported. Please use version 2.0 or above to access Plurk API 2.0.

The [OAuth library](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/) is written by [Andy Smith](http://term.ie/). You may try to update the file(s) if there is any update.
